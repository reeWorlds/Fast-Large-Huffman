FTS - First Table Size (parameters of decoding algorithm)
CPB - Codes Per Bitstream (typically, = 64 / huff_max_len). Preferably hardcoded as constant during compaltion. 

A1.0.0 and A2.0.0 are algorithms from paper.
A1.1.0 and A2.1.0 are algorithms from paper + intrinsic optimization.
A1.0.1 and A2.0.1 are algorithms from paper + bitstream optimization.
A1.1.1 and A2.1.1 are algorithms from paper + intrinsic optimization + bitstream optimization.

Note 1:
For "hp1", CPB = 4 is ok (decoding is bitexact).
For CPB = 4, decoding time on "hp1" for A2.0.1 and A2.1.1 is 0.294 and 0.287 respectively.
Hovever, such optimization is unpractical, as in general case of 4 consecutive 17-bit codes 68 bits will be taken from 64-bit bitstream.
